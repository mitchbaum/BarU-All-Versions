# BarU iOS App

# Purpose

- A tool that hosts the real time data for every bar in a college town, such as cover charge, line wait time, specials, and capacity level in one location that is easy to update from the bar owner side and easy/fun to use on the customer side. Never guess about which bar to go to again!

- The first social hub for all bars and drinking organizations in a college town! Owners can finally see the competitionâ€™s drink specials, cover charges, big announcements, and even the foot traffic via a wait time feature.

- Owners can communicate real-time to their customers by an easy update system that automatically persists bar data (wait times, cover, poppin status, etc) directly to their customers. Using this feature the bar owner can post real-time drink special updates or upcoming announcements such as a live artist, stand-up comedy, or other social events happening.

Created using Swift, UIKit, Google Cloud - Firebase
